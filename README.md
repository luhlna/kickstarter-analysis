# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

We performed an analysis on Kickstarter data to help Louise determine whether it is plausible to start her Crowdfunding campaing for her upcomming play with an estimated budget of $10K.

With a set of over 4000 Kickstarter campaings we started to understood and, therefore, generate insights that will help Louise's project.
First, we sorted the data by categories to get an overview of the onew with the best outcomes; where we found out "Theater" was the most successful one:

Then, we wanted to find if there is somekind of seasonality on when a Theater campaing tends to be more successful; so we found a peak on May.

Finally, with some statistical analysis on Kickstarters Plays in the US to determine whether there are any trends between the goals and pledges in successful or failed campaigns.

Thanks to this analysis we found out that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns and Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal; a value on the edge of the outliers. Even if asking for a higher amount of money doesn't set a campaing to fail, we should rely on the data to restructure the goal between the IQR so Louise can have a better chance reaching her goal. Asaid from setting a lower goal, we reccomend her to place her campaing during the month of May for about a month.
